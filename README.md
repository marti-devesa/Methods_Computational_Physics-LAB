# Methods in Computational Physics Laboratory

The accompanying document "Likelihood analysis of $\gamma$-ray flares in 3C 279" describes a practical session of data analysis performed in the course of "Methods for Computational Physics Laboratory" during WS 2021/22 and WS 2022/23. 
This is part of the Master programm in Physics at University of Innsbruck. Although it is designed for master students, it might be useful as an introductory tutorial to the analsis of Fermi-LAT data.

This document compiles and summarises information from the Fermi Science Support Center (https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/).
